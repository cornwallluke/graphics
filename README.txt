This is a scene of kingsgate bridge in durham. It uses point and directional lighting schemes. 
It has a diffuse and ambient lighting with normal mapping on the water and on the concrete bridge parts. 
The trees are 'randomly' generated and can be reset. Wind is modelled with a skew on the trees.
It models how the bridge was constructed.

It can be run in two ways, option 1 might have significantly better performance:

1: simply go into public and run index.html in a browser that has a relaxed cors policy (firefox [chrome doesn't support the fetch api for local files])

2: in this directory open command line (with node.js and npm installed)
2.1: type npm install
2.2: type npm start
2.3: in a browser navigate to localhost:8080
